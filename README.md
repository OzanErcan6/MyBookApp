# BookLover's Social Media Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the BookLover's Social Media app! This Java Spring Boot application serves as the backbone of our platform, enabling users to connect and share their passion for books.

## Tech Stack

Our backend is built on a robust and modern tech stack that provides a strong foundation for building a feature-rich and scalable social media platform for book lovers. Here are the key technologies we've used:

- **Java Spring Boot:** Our application is powered by Spring Boot, a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of robust and scalable web applications. Spring Boot offers features like dependency injection, security, and data access that are essential for building a secure and high-performance backend.

- **Hibernate:** We use Hibernate, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, to interact with the PostgreSQL database. Hibernate simplifies database operations by allowing us to work with Java objects instead of raw SQL queries.

- **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is our chosen relational database management system. It provides data persistence and ensures data integrity while offering advanced features for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

- **Docker:** We containerize our PostgreSQL database using Docker, making it easy to manage and deploy database instances consistently across different environments. Docker containers also simplify database versioning and scaling.

This tech stack combination provides the flexibility, security, and scalability required to create a seamless experience for our users. It allows us to focus on building innovative features while ensuring the reliability and performance of our backend.
